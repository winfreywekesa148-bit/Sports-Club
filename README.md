## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
